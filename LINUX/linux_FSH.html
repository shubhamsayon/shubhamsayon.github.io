<h2><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;"><em>The Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS) defines the structure of file systems in Unix/Linux, like operating systems.</em></span></strong></h2>
<h2><span style="color: #ffffff; background-color: #000000;"><strong>Remember&nbsp;In Linux everything is a file</strong></span></h2>
<h3><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">/: The Root Directory</span></strong> - The Primary hirearchy root directory which contains all other directories and files.</h3>
<h3><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>/bin:</strong></span> Essential User Binaries - contains definitions of all the basic commands commonly used by the user. for eg: ls,cp,cat,grep.</h3>
<h3><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>/boot:</strong></span> Static Boot Files- contains boot loader related files that are needed during the startup of the system; such as Kernal intrid(Initial RAM Disk image)</h3>
<h3><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>/dev:</strong> </span>Device Files- conatins the files for various devices on the system, like Hard Drives,RAM,CPU,cdrom</h3>
<h3><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>/etc:</strong></span> Configuration Files- contains the configuration files which affect the system when user is modifying anything. Also has service scripts like (start,stop,enable,shutdown,status)</h3>
<h3><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>/home:</strong></span> User's Home Directories- This is where users save their personal files.</h3>
<h3><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>/lib:</strong></span> Essential Shared Libraries- conatins important dynamic libraries</h3>
<h3><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>/media:</strong></span> Removable Media- Temporary mount directory for external removable media (CDs,DVDs).</h3>
<h3><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>/mnt:</strong></span> Temporary Mount Points- Teporary mount directory where we can mount filesystems temporarily.</h3>
<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Point to Remember</strong></span></h3>
<h3><span style="color: #ff0000;"><em>/media is mount point for removable media. In other words, where system mounts removable media. This directory contains sub-directories used for mounting removable media such as CD-ROMs, floppy disks, etc.</em></span></h3>
<h3><span style="color: #ff0000;"><em>/mnt is for temporary mounting. In other words, where user can mount things. This directory is generally used for mounting filesytems temporarily when needed.</em></span></h3>
<h3><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>/opt:</strong></span> Optional Packages - Third party softwares which are not available in official repository are installed in this folder.</h3>
<h3><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>/proc:</strong></span> Kernel &amp; Process Files &ndash; A virtual filesystem that contains information about running process (/proc/(pid), kernel &amp; system resources (/proc/uptime &amp; /proc/vmstat).</h3>
<h3><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>/root:</strong></span> Root Home Directory &ndash;it is the root user&rsquo;s home directory.</h3>
<h3><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>/srv:</strong></span> Service Data - Site-specific data served by this system, such as data and scripts for web servers, data offered by FTP servers, and repositories for version control systems.</h3>
<h3><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>/sys:</strong></span> virtual filesystem or pseudo file system - information about devices, drivers and kernal features.</h3>
<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>POINT TO REMEMBER</strong></span></h3>
<h3><em><span style="color: #ff0000;"> The /sys filesystem (sysfs) contains files that provide information about devices: whether it's powered on, the vendor name and model, what bus the device is plugged into, etc. It's of interest to applications that manage devices.</span></em></h3>
<h3><em><span style="color: #ff0000;">The /dev filesystem contains files that allow programs to access the devices themselves: write data to a serial port, read a hard disk, etc. It's of interest to applications that access devices.</span></em></h3>
<h3><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>/tmp:</strong></span> Temporary Directory - Contains temporary files (see also /var/tmp). Often not preserved between system reboots, and may be severely size restricted.</h3>
<h3><strong>/usr</strong>: User Binaries- Secondary hierarchy for read-only user data; contains the majority of (multi-)user utilities and applications.The /usr/local hierarchy is for use by the system administrator when installing software locally. It needs to be safe from being overwritten when the system software is updated. It may be used for programs and data that are shareable amongst a group of hosts, but not found in /usr .</h3>
<h3><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>/var:</strong></span> Variable- Variable files&mdash;files whose content is expected to continually change during normal operation of the system&mdash;such as logs, spool files, and temporary e-mail files.It contains Application cache files (/var/cache), package manager &amp; database files (/var/lib), lock file (/var/lock), various logs (/var/log), users mailboxes (/var/mail) &amp; print queues and outgoing mail queue (/var/spool).</h3>
