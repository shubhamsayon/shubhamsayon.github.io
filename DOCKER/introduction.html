<h3><span style="color: #800000;"><strong>Docker </strong></span><strong>is a container management service.</strong></h3>
<h3><strong>The concept of docker revolves around the idea that developers can easily develop applications, ship them into containers which can be deployed anywhere.</strong></h3>
<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Containers</strong></span></span></h3>
<h3><strong>A </strong><strong><em>container</em></strong><strong> is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another. In other words containers are an abstraction at the application layer that packages codes and dependencies together. This means instead of simply shipping the application , containers ship the application as well as the runtime environment needed to run the application.</strong></h3>
<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #800000;"><strong>Containers vs VMs</strong></span></h3>
<h3><strong>Virtual machines and containers differ in several ways, but the primary difference is that containers provide a way to virtualize an OS so that multiple workloads can run on a single OS instance. With VMs, the hardware is being virtualized to run multiple OS instances. Containers&rsquo; speed, agility, and portability make them yet another tool to help streamline software development.</strong></h3>
