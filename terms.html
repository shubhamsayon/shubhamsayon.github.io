<h3><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Container:</span>&nbsp;A&nbsp;<em>container</em>&nbsp;is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another. In other words containers are an abstraction at the application layer that packages codes and dependencies together. This means instead of simply shipping the application , containers ship the application as well as the runtime environment needed to run the application.</strong></h3>
